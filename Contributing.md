## Interested in learning Rust, know CPP

This is essentially a re-write of a CPP code base. I'd be happy to help you navigate the rust learning-curve as part of getting a PR through

DM me in the community forum(@Ben-PH)/discord(#Hawkey5212) and we can have a chat about getting started.

## Not interested in Rust, but familiar with Simple FOC code base

There are gaps in my knowledge that I'm working on filling. There are also a lot of improvements that Rust is particularly well suited for if you deeply understand the operating principals the code is responsible for. I have a big overlap between these two domains. For example, `float` is quite common in Simple FOC, but Rust has some very nice ways to do away with floats so long as you understand everything going on.

> Sounds cool to get involved? How about...

Search through the github issues, where I raise some thoughts/questions. The code-base also follows the SFOC structure somewhat closely, and if you see some `todo!()`s, or missing implementations, raise an issue.

DM me is also a great option

## Want to improve the Simple FOC code base

This is very much a "fresh-eyes" project. 

- I've already seen that the phase-state enum should instead express the on/off state of each pin inside a struct.
- I will be, in a way, "auditing" the use of floats and seeing where integers can be used
- I will be writing things so that a rotary/linear(/other?) motors are concrete implementations of the generic `Motor`
- ...

To me, the work done here feeding benefits back through to Simple FOC would bring be a great thing to see. If contributing to discussions, documentation, code, etc takes your fancy, you will also be contributing to Simple FOC improvements, though perhaps less directly.

> Sounds cool to get involved? How about...

Point me in the direction of any discussions aleady being had about things that need to be improved/added/etc in SFOC that deserves to get attention during a re-write. 

And as always, DMs welcome.

## Know Rust, but everything else about this is new and strange?

Are you me? Please don't make me disapear and replace me. I like my life :)


## Just want to give support?

Starring the repo is not nothing. Supporting Ukraine in some meaningful way and letting me know it's because you read also helps (DM, github issue, etc).
